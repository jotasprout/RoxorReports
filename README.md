_Dynamic PDF Acrobat Javascript application for private investigator_
## Requirements to be in a ToC and each have own MD file
* populating a menu based on text fields 
* dashboard might be updated after those pages (containing menus with unique names) are spawned.
* Other information on the dashboard appears on all pages' footers such as Case Name, Case Number, Date, and Page Number. 
* Unique field names meant I needed to be creative (because the dashboard content such as date completed/submitted and such might not be entered until the end of the investigation). 
* User needs to be able to rearrange and remove pages at will. This affected several things including but not limited to the page numbers. While the client owns Acrobat Pro ...
* all of this needs to be possible after the client has saved, closed, and reopened the file as well.
* I wanted the client have as little burden as possible. I wanted a design and process that was elegant, easy and simple.
* client's customers want to see they're going to get _something_ for their money. If the investigator shows the fruit of their labor, however, their customer can then just run with that information to their lawyer. So, I need to creatively redact information while still showing there's something substantial.
* Related to redaction but with other, more typical concerns like preventing printing, watermarks, and of course preventing changes ... all without requiring my client learn or do any more than they have to.
